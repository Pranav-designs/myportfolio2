I have a strong interest in technology, with a focus on circuit design, embedded systems, and programming. Iâ€™m passionate about learning and have gained proficiency in coding languages such as <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, and <strong>HTML</strong>. I enjoy building projects that combine both my knowledge of electronics and software, and I am excited to explore more advanced topics in these fields.
